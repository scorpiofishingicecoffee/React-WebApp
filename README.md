# Requi. Notes

~~Use the create-react-app generator to start your project.~~

~~Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: create-react-app (Links to an external site.)~~

Your app should have one HTML page to render your react application

Your app should use multiple components in a way that keeps your code well organized.

There should be 3 routes

The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs (Links to an external site.); docs for v4 can be found here (Links to an external site.))


Your app must incorporate API data. This data can be from a public API or from a GitHub JSON file you create


Your app must persist some data using a JSON server as a mock up backend


Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to incorporate a UI framework (like react-bootstrap (Links to an external site.) or material-ui (Links to an external site.)), but if you want to write CSS yourself, go for it!
